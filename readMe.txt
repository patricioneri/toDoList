Tiny practice of a tasklist in which I practice DOM, handle of events, functions and the use of dates. 
Also the app has styles with CSS.
In the app the user can add new tasks and every task will be render in a list. Also, each task can be clicked and it will be catalogued as done. Finally, the user can order the tasks with a button, sending the 'done' tasks to the end of the list.
